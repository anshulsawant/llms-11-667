# Detailed Session Summary

**Note:** This is a summary reconstructing the key interactions, decisions, and generated artifacts during the session. It aims to reflect the iterative development process.

**Session Goal:** Develop a Python project for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the Gemma 9B model on the GSM8K dataset, explore different tuning methods, and create supporting documentation and tools.

**Chronological Summary:**

1.  **Initial SFT Script Request:** User requested Python code for full SFT (Gemma 9B on GSM8K), specifying requirements like YAML config (`OmegaConf`), WandB logging, and evaluation of both base and SFT models.
2.  **Code Generation (`config.yaml`, `sft_script.py`):** Generated the initial configuration file and the core Python script implementing the requested features using `transformers.Trainer`.
3.  **Refinement - Optimizer & Precision:** User requested using paged 8-bit Adam (`adamw_bnb_8bit`) and `bfloat16` precision. Code and config were updated accordingly, removing initial PEFT/quantization placeholders.
4.  **Dependency Management (`requirements.txt`):** Generated `requirements.txt` based on script imports and configuration. Clarified that `huggingface_cli` is part of `huggingface_hub` and used for setup (login).
5.  **Project Packaging (`setup.py`):** Generated `setup.py` to make the project installable, later updated to support an `src/` layout as requested by the user. Clarified the necessity of the `src/sft_project/__init__.py` file (can be empty) for package recognition by Python and `setuptools`.
6.  **Documentation (`README.md`):** Generated a comprehensive `README.md` covering project structure, setup, configuration, training execution (`accelerate launch`), finding results, and initial inference instructions. *Note: This artifact required multiple regenerations due to display issues.*
7.  **Inference Script (`inference.py`):** User requested a more user-friendly way to run inference. Generated `inference.py` script using `argparse` for command-line control, supporting loading models and processing prompts from JSONL files. Updated `README.md` with usage instructions.
8.  **Evaluation Enhancement (Base Model Prompting):** User requested evaluating the base model using configurable zero-shot or one-shot prompting for fairer comparison. Updated `config.yaml` (added `base_model_prompt_strategy`, `one_shot_example`) and `sft_script.py` (modified `evaluate_gsm8k` function). User requested a shorter one-shot example to avoid exceeding sequence length, which was updated in `config.yaml`. Estimated token count for the example was provided upon request.
9.  **LoRA Integration Request:** User proposed comparing Full SFT with LoRA PEFT.
10. **Multi-File Update for LoRA:** Incorporated LoRA as an option by:
    * Adding `peft` to `requirements.txt`.
    * Adding `tuning_method` and `lora_config` sections to `config.yaml`.
    * Modifying `sft_script.py` to conditionally apply LoRA using `get_peft_model` and `LoraConfig`. Included `model.print_trainable_parameters()` for LoRA.
    * Modifying `inference.py` to accept an optional `--adapter_path` and load adapters onto the base model using `PeftModel`.
    * Updating `README.md` extensively to explain both methods, configuration, results interpretation (adapters vs full model), and inference usage for both cases.
11. **Supporting Artifacts (Presentation & Report):** Generated a presentation outline (`sft_presentation_outline`) and a detailed project report structure (`sft_project_report`) with placeholders for results and discussion sections comparing Full SFT vs. LoRA and Main vs. Socratic dataset performance, as requested.
12. **Discussion & Clarifications:** Addressed user questions regarding:
    * GPU memory requirements for Full SFT vs. LoRA, providing estimations based on model size, precision, batch size, and optimizations (gradient checkpointing, 8-bit Adam).
    * How to get trainable parameter counts for both methods (highlighting the existing `print_trainable_parameters()` call for LoRA).
    * The purpose and separation of the `accelerate` configuration from the script's `config.yaml`.
13. **Refinement - Minimum Learning Rate Scheduler:**
    * User requested setting a minimum LR for the cosine scheduler.
    * Initial Response: Explained limitations of standard `cosine` scheduler in `transformers` (anneals to 0) and suggested custom scheduler implementation.
    * User Suggestion 1: Use `"cosine_with_min_lr"` string.
    * Response 1: Stated this string wasn't found in standard `SchedulerType` based on initial doc check.
    * User Correction 1: Provided quote indicating `"cosine_with_min_lr"` exists.
    * Response 2 (Implementation Attempt 1): Apologized for oversight. Explained `Trainer` integration issues with non-standard args. Modified `sft_script.py` to manually create optimizer and the specific scheduler (`get_cosine_with_min_lr_schedule_with_warmup`), assuming a `min_lr_factor` argument. Updated `config.yaml` accordingly.
    * User Suggestion 2: Use `lr_scheduler_kw_args`.
    * Response 3: Incorrectly stated `lr_scheduler_kwargs` didn't exist in `TrainingArguments`.
    * User Correction 2: Provided quote showing `lr_scheduler_kwargs` exists in `TrainingArguments`.
    * Response 4 (Implementation Attempt 2): Apologized again. Corrected implementation to use `lr_scheduler_kwargs` in `config.yaml` and reverted `sft_script.py` to standard `Trainer` init, but initially used incorrect key `min_lr_factor` inside kwargs.
    * User Correction 3: Clarified the correct key inside kwargs is `min_lr` (absolute value).
    * Response 5 (Final Implementation): Corrected `config.yaml` to use `lr_scheduler_kwargs: {min_lr: <value>}`. Corrected validation logic in `sft_script.py`. Updated `README.md`.
14. **Current Request:** Generate this detailed session summary.

**Final Project State:** The project now includes configurable Full SFT and LoRA SFT, evaluation of base/SFT models with options for base model prompting, WandB logging, a dedicated inference script supporting both tuning methods, packaging files (`setup.py`, `requirements.txt`), and documentation (`README.md`, presentation outline, report outline). The training configuration supports standard schedulers and `cosine_with_min_lr` via `lr_scheduler_kwargs`.
