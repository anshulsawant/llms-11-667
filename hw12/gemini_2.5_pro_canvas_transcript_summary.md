# Session Summary: Collaborative SFT Project Development

**Note:** This summary reconstructs the key interactions, decisions, and generated artifacts during the session, aiming to highlight the collaborative and user-guided development process for project documentation purposes. It is not a verbatim transcript.

**Session Goal:** Collaboratively develop a Python project for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the Gemma 9B model on the GSM8K dataset, explore different tuning methods (Full SFT and LoRA), and create supporting documentation and tools.

**Development Log:**

1.  **Initial User Request & Scoping:** The session began with the user requesting Python code for **full SFT** of `gemma-2-9b-it` on `gsm8k`. Key initial requirements specified by the user included:
    * Configuration via YAML (`OmegaConf`).
    * Logging to Weights & Biases (`wandb`).
    * Evaluation of both the pre-trained base model and the fine-tuned model.
    * Explicit exclusion of PEFT methods at this stage.
2.  **Code Generation (`config.yaml`, `sft_script.py`):** Based on the user's requirements, the initial `config.yaml` and the core `sft_script.py` (using `transformers.Trainer`) were generated.
3.  **User-Guided Refinement (Optimizer & Precision):** The user directed the refinement towards specific optimizations:
    * Requested the use of the **paged 8-bit Adam optimizer** (`adamw_bnb_8bit`).
    * Specified the use of **`bfloat16`** precision.
    * Confirmed removal of any PEFT/quantization placeholders.
    * *Action:* Code and configuration were updated to reflect these specific choices.
4.  **Dependency Management (`requirements.txt`):** Upon user request, `requirements.txt` was generated. A follow-up user query clarified the role of `huggingface_cli` (part of `huggingface_hub`, used for setup).
5.  **Project Structuring (`setup.py`, `src/` layout, `__init__.py`):**
    * User requested `setup.py` to package the project.
    * User then specified the desire for a standard `src/` layout, requiring modification of `setup.py` (using `find_packages(where="src")` and `package_dir`).
    * User inquired about the necessity of `__init__.py` within the source directory, leading to an explanation of its role in package recognition by Python and `setuptools`.
6.  **Documentation & Usability (`README.md`, `inference.py`):**
    * User requested a comprehensive `README.md`. Generated initial version covering setup, config, training, etc. (*Note: Multiple regenerations were needed due to display issues, prompted by the user.*)
    * User requested a more user-friendly inference method, leading to the generation of `inference.py` with command-line arguments and JSONL file handling. `README.md` was updated accordingly.
7.  **Evaluation Strategy Enhancement:**
    * User proposed evaluating the base model using **zero-shot or one-shot prompting** for fairer comparison.
    * *Action:* Updated `config.yaml` and `sft_script.py` to support this configurable strategy.
    * User identified the initial one-shot example as potentially too long and requested a **shorter example**, which was then updated in `config.yaml`. User inquired about token count for the new example.
8.  **Exploring PEFT (LoRA Integration):**
    * User expressed interest in **comparing Full SFT with LoRA**.
    * *Action:* This required significant updates across multiple files, guided by the user's request:
        * Added `peft` to `requirements.txt`.
        * Added `tuning_method` and `lora_config` to `config.yaml`.
        * Modified `sft_script.py` to conditionally apply LoRA adapters.
        * Modified `inference.py` to support loading LoRA adapters via `--adapter_path`.
        * Updated `README.md` to cover both methods comprehensively.
9.  **Supporting Artifacts (Presentation & Report):**
    * User requested a **presentation outline**, which was generated and later updated to include the LoRA comparison point based on user feedback.
    * User requested a **detailed project report outline** with placeholders for results and discussion comparing methods and dataset variations (Main vs. Socratic).
10. **Technical Discussions & Clarifications (User-Initiated):**
    * User inquired about **GPU memory requirements** for both Full SFT and LoRA, leading to detailed estimations and discussion of trade-offs.
    * User asked how to retrieve **trainable parameter counts** for both methods.
    * User asked about the separation and purpose of the **`accelerate` configuration**.
    * User asked about the commonality and implementation of **gradient clipping** (leading to clarification that `max_grad_norm` could be added to config).
    * User asked why **`SFTTrainer`** wasn't used (leading to discussion of standard `Trainer` flexibility vs. TRL abstractions).
11. **Refinement - Learning Rate Scheduler (`cosine_with_min_lr`):** This involved a detailed iterative process driven by user input and corrections:
    * User requested setting a minimum learning rate for the cosine scheduler.
    * Initial LLM Response: Explained limitations of standard `cosine` type in `transformers` and suggested custom implementation was needed.
    * User Correction 1: Suggested `"cosine_with_min_lr"` string exists.
    * LLM Response 1: Incorrectly stated the string wasn't standard after checking linked docs.
    * User Correction 2: Provided quote showing `"cosine_with_min_lr"` mapping.
    * LLM Response 2 (Implementation 1): Apologized; explained `Trainer` integration issues with non-standard args; implemented manual optimizer/scheduler creation in `sft_script.py` assuming a `min_lr_factor` argument.
    * User Suggestion: Proposed using `lr_scheduler_kw_args`.
    * LLM Response 3: Incorrectly stated `lr_scheduler_kwargs` didn't exist in `TrainingArguments`.
    * User Correction 3: Provided quote showing `lr_scheduler_kwargs` exists.
    * LLM Response 4 (Implementation 2): Apologized; reverted `sft_script.py` to standard `Trainer` init; correctly used `lr_scheduler_kwargs` in `config.yaml` but used placeholder key `min_lr_factor`.
    * User Correction 4: Clarified the correct key inside kwargs is `min_lr` (absolute value).
    * LLM Response 5 (Final Implementation): Corrected `config.yaml`, `sft_script.py` validation, and `README.md` to use `lr_scheduler_kwargs: {min_lr: <value>}`.
12. **Configuration Management (Overrides & Toy Configs):**
    * User asked about creating **variant config files** containing only overrides for a base config.
    * *Action:* Confirmed feasibility with `OmegaConf.merge`; updated `load_config` in `sft_script.py` to handle base + override logic; generated four specific override configs (`config_full_main.yaml`, etc.).
    * User requested updating the previously generated **toy config files** (`config_toy_full.yaml`, `config_toy_lora.yaml`) to also work as override files based on the new merging logic.
    * *Action:* Updated the toy config immersives.

**Outcome:** The session resulted in a functional Python project for SFT (Full and LoRA) with supporting scripts, configuration files for main experiments and testing, documentation, and presentation/report outlines, developed through a collaborative process with significant user guidance and correction.
