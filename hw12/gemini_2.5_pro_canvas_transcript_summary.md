# Session Transcript Summary

**Note:** This is a summary of key interactions and generated artifacts, not a verbatim transcript.

1.  **Initial Request:** Generate Python code for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a Hugging Face model (`gemma-2-9b-it` on `gsm8k`). Requirements included YAML configuration (`OmegaConf`), WandB logging, full SFT (no PEFT initially), and evaluation of base vs. SFT models.
2.  **Generated `config.yaml`:** Created initial YAML configuration (`sft_config_yaml`) for model, dataset, training hyperparameters, WandB, and evaluation.
3.  **Generated `sft_script.py`:** Created the main Python script (`sft_script_py`) with functions for loading config, data, model, tokenizer, evaluation (including GSM8K answer extraction), and training using `transformers.Trainer`.
4.  **Refinements:** Modified script/config based on requests:
    * Use paged 8-bit Adam (`adamw_bnb_8bit`).
    * Use `bfloat16` precision.
    * Removed PEFT/quantization code remnants.
5.  **Generated `requirements.txt`:** Created a requirements file (`requirements_txt`) listing necessary Python packages.
6.  **Clarification:** Discussed `huggingface_cli` (tool vs. library).
7.  **Generated `setup.py`:** Created a `setup.py` file (`setup_py`) for packaging the project, later updated for an `src/` layout.
8.  **Generated `README.md`:** Created a comprehensive README (`readme_md`) covering setup, configuration, training, results, and initial inference instructions. Updated multiple times due to display issues and content additions.
9.  **Generated `inference.py`:** Created a dedicated script (`inference_script_py`) for user-friendly inference using command-line arguments, reading from/writing to JSONL files.
10. **Evaluation Enhancement:** Modified `sft_script.py` and `config.yaml` to allow configurable zero-shot or one-shot prompting for base model evaluation.
11. **LoRA Integration Request:** User requested incorporating LoRA as an alternative fine-tuning method.
12. **Multi-File Update for LoRA:**
    * Updated `requirements.txt` (add `peft`).
    * Updated `config.yaml` (add `tuning_method`, `lora_config`).
    * Updated `sft_script.py` (add PEFT logic, `print_trainable_parameters`).
    * Updated `inference.py` (add `--adapter_path` argument, logic to load adapters).
    * Updated `README.md` (explain LoRA option, config, training, results, inference).
13. **Generated Presentation Outline:** Created a 6-slide presentation outline (`sft_presentation_outline`) summarizing the project, later updated to include LoRA comparison points.
14. **Generated Project Report Outline:** Created a detailed project report structure (`sft_project_report`) with placeholders for results and discussion comparing Full SFT vs. LoRA and Main vs. Socratic datasets.
15. **Discussions:**
    * Difference between AdamW variants.
    * GPU memory requirements for Full SFT vs. LoRA as a function of batch size.
    * Purpose of `accelerate` config (separate from `config.yaml`).
    * Necessity of `__init__.py` file.
    * How to get trainable parameter counts.
    * Limitations regarding transcript download.
