# Session Summary: Collaborative SFT Project Development

**Note:** This summary reconstructs the key interactions, decisions, and generated artifacts during the session, aiming to highlight the collaborative and user-guided development process for project documentation purposes. It is not a verbatim transcript.

**Session Goal:** Collaboratively develop a Python project for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the Gemma 9B model on the GSM8K dataset, explore different tuning methods (Full SFT and LoRA), and create supporting documentation and tools.

**Development Log:**

1.  **Initial User Request & Scoping:** The session began with the user requesting Python code for **full SFT** of `gemma-2-9b-it` on `gsm8k`. Key initial requirements specified by the user included:
    * Configuration via YAML (`OmegaConf`).
    * Logging to Weights & Biases (`wandb`).
    * Evaluation of both the pre-trained base model and the fine-tuned model.
    * Explicit exclusion of PEFT methods at this stage.
2.  **Code Generation (`config.yaml`, `sft_script.py`):** Based on the user's requirements, the initial `config.yaml` and the core `sft_script.py` (using `transformers.Trainer`) were generated.
3.  **User-Guided Refinement (Optimizer & Precision):** The user directed the refinement towards specific optimizations:
    * Requested the use of the **paged 8-bit Adam optimizer** (`adamw_bnb_8bit`).
    * Specified the use of **`bfloat16`** precision.
    * Confirmed removal of any PEFT/quantization placeholders.
    * *Action:* Code and configuration were updated to reflect these specific choices.
4.  **Dependency Management (`requirements.txt`):** Upon user request, `requirements.txt` was generated. A follow-up user query clarified the role of `huggingface_cli` (part of `huggingface_hub`, used for setup).
5.  **Project Structuring (`setup.py`, `src/` layout, `__init__.py`):**
    * User requested `setup.py` to package the project.
    * User then specified the desire for a standard `src/` layout, requiring modification of `setup.py` (using `find_packages(where="src")` and `package_dir`).
    * User inquired about the necessity of `__init__.py` within the source directory, leading to an explanation of its role in package recognition by Python and `setuptools`.
6.  **Documentation & Usability (`README.md`, `inference.py`):**
    * User requested a comprehensive `README.md`. Generated initial version covering setup, config, training, etc. (*Note: Multiple regenerations were needed due to display issues, prompted by the user.*)
    * User requested a more user-friendly inference method, leading to the generation of `inference.py` with command-line arguments and JSONL file handling. `README.md` was updated accordingly.
7.  **Evaluation Strategy Enhancement:**
    * User proposed evaluating the base model using **zero-shot or one-shot prompting** for fairer comparison.
    * *Action:* Updated `config.yaml` and `sft_script.py` to support this configurable strategy.
    * User identified the initial one-shot example as potentially too long and requested a **shorter example**, which was then updated in `config.yaml`. User inquired about token count for the new example.
8.  **Exploring PEFT (LoRA Integration):**
    * User expressed interest in **comparing Full SFT with LoRA**.
    * *Action:* This required significant updates across multiple files, guided by the user's request:
        * Added `peft` to `requirements.txt`.
        * Added `tuning_method` and `lora_config` to `config.yaml`.
        * Modified `sft_script.py` to conditionally apply LoRA adapters.
        * Modified `inference.py` to support loading LoRA adapters via `--adapter_path`.
        * Updated `README.md` to cover both methods comprehensively.
9.  **Supporting Artifacts (Presentation & Report):**
    * User requested a **presentation outline**, which was generated and later updated to include the LoRA comparison point based on user feedback.
    * User requested a **detailed project report outline** with placeholders for results and discussion comparing methods and dataset variations (Main vs. Socratic).
10. **Technical Discussions & Clarifications (User-Initiated):**
    * User inquired about **GPU memory requirements** for both Full SFT and LoRA, leading to detailed estimations and discussion of trade-offs.
    * User asked how to retrieve **trainable parameter counts** for both methods.
    * User asked about the separation and purpose of the **`accelerate` configuration**.
    * User asked about the commonality and implementation of **gradient clipping** (leading to clarification that `max_grad_norm` could be added to config).
    * User asked why **`SFTTrainer`** wasn't used (leading to discussion of standard `Trainer` flexibility vs. TRL abstractions).
11. **Refinement - Learning Rate Scheduler (`cosine_with_min_lr`):** This involved a detailed iterative process driven by user input and corrections:
    * User requested setting a minimum learning rate for the cosine scheduler.
    * Initial LLM Response: Explained limitations of standard `cosine` type in `transformers` and suggested custom implementation was needed.
    * User Correction 1: Suggested `"cosine_with_min_lr"` string exists.
    * LLM Response 1: Incorrectly stated the string wasn't standard after checking linked docs.
    * User Correction 2: Provided quote showing `"cosine_with_min_lr"` mapping.
    * LLM Response 2 (Implementation 1): Apologized; explained `Trainer` integration issues with non-standard args; implemented manual optimizer/scheduler creation in `sft_script.py` assuming a `min_lr_factor` argument.
    * User Suggestion: Proposed using `lr_scheduler_kw_args`.
    * LLM Response 3: Incorrectly stated `lr_scheduler_kwargs` didn't exist in `TrainingArguments`.
    * User Correction 3: Provided quote showing `lr_scheduler_kwargs` exists.
    * LLM Response 4 (Implementation 2): Apologized; reverted `sft_script.py` to standard `Trainer` init; correctly used `lr_scheduler_kwargs` in `config.yaml` but used placeholder key `min_lr_factor`.
    * User Correction 4: Clarified the correct key inside kwargs is `min_lr` (absolute value).
    * LLM Response 5 (Final Implementation): Corrected `config.yaml`, `sft_script.py` validation, and `README.md` to use `lr_scheduler_kwargs: {min_lr: <value>}`.
12. **Configuration Management (Overrides & Toy Configs):**
    * User asked about creating **variant config files** containing only overrides for a base config.
    * *Action:* Confirmed feasibility with `OmegaConf.merge`; updated `load_config` in `sft_script.py` to handle base + override logic; generated four specific override configs (`config_full_main.yaml`, etc.).
    * User requested updating the previously generated **toy config files** (`config_toy_full.yaml`, `config_toy_lora.yaml`) to also work as override files based on the new merging logic.
    * *Action:* Updated the toy config immersives.

## Post-Refinement Development & Analysis (Continued from above)

13. **Model Change (Gemma 9B -> 2B):**
    * Based on user observation of high baseline accuracy (~86%) for `gemma-9b-it`, the decision was made to switch to `google/gemma-2b-it` to better observe the impact of fine-tuning.
    * *Action:* Updated `model.name` in the base `config.yaml` (Artifact ID: `sft_config_yaml`). Updated `README.md` (Artifact ID: `readme_txt_gemma2b`) to reflect this change and the reasoning.

14. **Script Debugging & Enhancement (Post-Model Change):**
    * **`evaluate.py` / `inference.py` / `utils.py`:** Addressed various errors arising from changes or previous oversights:
        * `TypeError` / `NameError` in `evaluate.py` related to `load_model_and_tokenizer` arguments and missing `sys` import. -> Fixed script logic and imports.
        * `ImportError` / `NameError` in `inference.py` related to missing utility functions (`read_jsonl`, `write_jsonl`, `init_wandb`) and logger scope. -> Added functions to `utils.py` and adjusted script structure.
        * `OverflowError` in `inference.py` tokenizer call. -> Fixed by simplifying `max_length` calculation to use config value directly.
        * Corrected `inference.py` to look for `one_shot_example` instead of `few_shot_example` in config.
    * **`train.py` (Artifact ID: `sft_train_py`):**
        * Implemented **label masking** in the tokenization step to ensure loss calculation only on answer tokens.
        * Fixed `ValueError` related to `remove_columns` during tokenization map (ensured all pre-tokenization columns were removed).
        * Fixed `NameError` for dataset variable name mismatch (`train_dataset` vs `tokenized_train_dataset`).
        * **LoRA + Gradient Checkpointing Debugging:** Addressed persistent `RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad...` when LoRA and GC were enabled. This involved:
            * Discussing memory trade-offs (activations vs parameters/optimizer states).
            * Verifying PEFT was creating trainable parameters via `print_trainable_parameters()`.
            * Ruling out issues with `prepare_model_for_kbit_training` (removed call).
            * Ruling out issues with explicit `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` (removed call).
            * Identifying the likely incompatibility between the PEFT model and default GC implementation.
            * **Resolution:** Added `gradient_checkpointing_kwargs={'use_reentrant': False}` to `TrainingArguments` when GC is enabled in config. User confirmed this resolved the error.
    * **Evaluation Speed:** Discussed why sample-by-sample evaluation was slow. Implemented **batched evaluation** in `evaluate.py` using `DataLoader` and `DataCollatorWithPadding` for significant speedup (Artifact ID: `sft_evaluate_py_generated`).
    * **Output Filenaming:** Implemented user-requested detailed output filename convention for both `inference.py` and `evaluate.py` based on config file, data file/split, model type, base model name, and dataset config name. Evaluation results directed to `./eval_results/`.

15. **WandB Logging Refinement:**
    * Investigated issue where training metrics weren't appearing in WandB Charts/Summary despite system metrics logging and `report_to=["wandb"]` being confirmed in config.
    * Deduced it was likely a WandB UI/sync issue as `wandb.init` was clearly working.
    * *Action:* Added an explicit `wandb.log(final_metrics)` call at the end of successful training runs in `train.py` as a safeguard to ensure summary data was sent directly. User later observed charts appearing in the "Workspace" tab.

16. **Results Analysis & Reporting:**
    * **LoRA vs. Full SFT Speed:** Discussed why LoRA wasn't dramatically faster than Full SFT for `gemma-2b-it`, attributing it to the forward pass dominating step time. Approximated LoRA parameter count (~30M).
    * **Log Parsing & Chart Generation:** User uploaded training logs. Generated Python script (`training_report_generator`) to parse logs and create comparison charts (Loss, Grad Norm, Throughput) and a summary metrics table.
    * **Evaluation Analysis:** User uploaded evaluation JSON results. Acknowledged receipt.
    * **Final Report Generation:** Created a Markdown report (`training_evaluation_report`) summarizing findings, incorporating the generated charts (via placeholders), evaluation results table, and analysis (including Loss vs. Performance mismatch between Socratic/Main datasets).
    * **Markdown Image Linking:** Fixed image links in the report for GitHub compatibility (Reference -> Inline style).
    * **Report Reorganization:** Reorganized the final report (`training_evaluation_report`) chronologically based on user feedback to better reflect the project's evolution. *(Correction: This summary report was reorganized instead based on user correction).*

17. **Capability Discussions:** Answered user questions regarding capabilities for creating Google Slides/Docs (cannot create files directly, but can provide content) and Markdown image syntax.

**Outcome:** The session successfully navigated numerous development and debugging challenges, resulting in functional Python scripts for Full SFT and LoRA training, evaluation, and inference, along with supporting configuration files, documentation, analysis code, and a final summary report, all shaped by iterative user feedback and collaboration.
