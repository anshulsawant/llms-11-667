\section{Question 1.1}
\label{sec:org137cbab}
\subsection{Prompt}
\label{sec:org27d7cfd}
Sekou writes the numbers 15, 16,17,18,19. After he erases one of his numbers, the sum of the remaining four numbers is a multiple of 4. Which number did he erase? [AMC8 2025]
\subsection{Model output}
\label{sec:org7ffe315}
First, calculate the sum of all the numbers Sekou wrote:

\[ 
15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 85 
\]

Next, determine which number can be erased so that the sum of the remaining numbers is a multiple of 4. 

Let's subtract each number from the total sum and check:

\begin{itemize}
\item Erasing 15: \(85 - 15 = 70\) (which is divisible by 4)
\item Erasing 16: \(85 - 16 = 69\)
\item Erasing 17: \(85 - 17 = 68\) (which is divisible by 4)
\item Erasing 18: \(85 - 18 = 67\)
\item Erasing 19: \(85 - 19 = 66\)
\end{itemize}

The sums 70 and 68 are multiples of 4. Sekou can erase either 15 or 17 to achieve this.

\subsection{Result expected}
\label{sec:org1c31651}
17

\subsection{Relative error rate}
\label{sec:orgc027c07}
One of the answers (15) is off by 11.76\%

\section{Question 1.3 B: Eval vs Safe Eval}
\label{sec:org310fa1c}
Eval will allow arbitrary python code to be executed. It may be possible to get model to generate dangerous python code, for example, via in-context learning.
\section{Question 1.4: Accuracy with and without calculator}
\label{sec:orge54e03b}
Accuracy with calculator is 60.13\%. Accuracy without calculator is 35.22\%.

\section{Question 1.5 A: Incorrect answer without calculator}
\label{sec:org1b5d3e1}
\subsection{Prompt}
\label{sec:org34da1ef}
Question: Since the townspeople requested that he makes a chocolate cake, he will need 306 lbs. of cocoa powder.
If the mayor already gave him 259 lbs., how much cocoa powder does he still need?
Answer:
\subsection{With calculator}
\label{sec:org667ec06}
Question: Since the townspeople requested that he makes a chocolate cake, he will need 306 lbs. of cocoa powder.
If the mayor already gave him 259 lbs., how much cocoa powder does he still need?
Answer:\label{org7d9834c}47
\subsection{Without calculator}
\label{sec:org9eaa74f}
Question: Since the townspeople requested that he makes a chocolate cake, he will need 306 lbs. of cocoa powder.
If the mayor already gave him 259 lbs., how much cocoa powder does he still need?
Answer:\label{orgc654815}13
\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:org19ee630}
While the model set up the computation correctly, it could not correctly compute the difference of the two numbers.

\section{Question 1.5 B: Incorrect answer with calculator}
\label{sec:org5b232a9}
\subsection{Prompt}
\label{sec:org9b3083e}
Question: Each side of a square kitchen tile is 7 inches long. What is the tile's area?
Answer:
\subsection{With calculator}
\label{sec:org20a7f5f}
Question: Each side of a square kitchen tile is 7 inches long. What is the tile's area?
Answer:\label{org4a6583c}28
\subsection{Without calculator}
\label{sec:org81e3f44}
Question: Each side of a square kitchen tile is 7 inches long. What is the tile's area?
Answer:\label{org78d20dc}28
\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:org0f3391b}
The model probably did not understand the concept of area.
