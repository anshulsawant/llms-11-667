* Question 1.1
** Prompt
Sekou writes the numbers 15, 16,17,18,19. After he erases one of his numbers, the sum of the remaining four numbers is a multiple of 4. Which number did he erase? [AMC8 2025]
** Model output
First, calculate the sum of all the numbers Sekou wrote:

\[ 
15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 85 
\]

Next, determine which number can be erased so that the sum of the remaining numbers is a multiple of 4. 

Let's subtract each number from the total sum and check:

- Erasing 15: \( 85 - 15 = 70 \) (which is divisible by 4)
- Erasing 16: \( 85 - 16 = 69 \)
- Erasing 17: \( 85 - 17 = 68 \) (which is divisible by 4)
- Erasing 18: \( 85 - 18 = 67 \)
- Erasing 19: \( 85 - 19 = 66 \)

The sums 70 and 68 are multiples of 4. Sekou can erase either 15 or 17 to achieve this.

** Result expected

* Question 1.3 B: Eval vs Safe Eval
Eval will allow arbitrary python code to be executed. It may be possible to get model to generate dangerous python code, for example, via in-context learning.
* Question 1.4: Accuracy with and without calculator
Accuracy with calculator is 60.13%. Accuracy without calculator is 35.22%.

Answer:<<306-259>>13
** Discussion
While the model set up the computation correctly, it could not correctly compute the difference of the two numbers.

* Question 1.5 B: Incorrect answer with calculator
