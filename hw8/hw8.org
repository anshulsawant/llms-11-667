* Q 1.1
** B
It is sounder to use last-token pooling with decoder-only models because decoders process tokens left to right and a decoder would not have processed all of the input before the last token.

* Q 1.4 Cross-encoding
** A
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def cross_encoder(query, passage):
      reprs = encoder(query + '[SEP]' + passage)
      similarity = Linear(reprs)
      return similarity
#+END_SRC

** B
*Advantage*: Higher accurary because jointly considering query and passages allows for more nuanced semantic relationships.
*Disadvantage*: Each query-passage pair requires a forward pass of the encoder making it more expensive. A bi-encoder will requires $|Q| + |P|$ forward passes whereas, a cross-encoder will require $|Q| \times |P|$ forward passes.

** C: Strategy to use both
A candidate set can be retrieved using bi-encoder and then this smaller set can be re-ranked using cross-encoder.
